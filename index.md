## Welcome to IndustryPortal

[IndustryPortal website](http://industryportal.enit.fr/) is designed to be an open portal, created as part of EU Horizon 2020 [OntoCommons](http://ontocommons.eu) project, providing permanent access to ontologies for annotating, modeling, and making industrial data interoperable. With the proliferation of semantic artifacts (i.e., vocabularies, taxonomies, and ontologies) in the  industry domain, the need to have a common infrastructure to facilitate identification, reuse, alignment, and maintenance is evidently clear. To alleviate the problem, a common ontology portal for industry is established to serve the community with a long term permanent repository for FAIR semantic artifacts. IndustryPortal also addresses one of the expected outcomes of the OntoCommons project, i.e., to develop a reference ontology repository for the industrial domain. IndustryPortal provide sustainable storage for all existing and future ontology artifacts and mappings, produced either internal or external  to OntoCommons project. Although, IndustryPortal is currently developed and maintained by Production Engineering Laboratory [LGP-ENIT](https://www.lgp.enit.fr/en/index.html), it heavily depends on the community to collect, curate, and maintain ontologies in the portal. 

> _"One of the main services that the OntoCommons project can offer is to
create a public resource where all the major ontologies, their uses, and their users, are
listed. This outcome can provide a practical benefit to the engineering and industrial
communities."_ - __Barry Smith,__ [__Interview with OntoCommons__](https://ontocommons.eu/news-events/news/ontocommons-standardisation-environment-interview-barry-smith).

In summary, the current version of IndustryPortal lets any user to:
* To submit a new ontology in public or private mode;  
*	To edit various ontology metadata (i.e., acronym, visibility, description, status, format, and contact) and other FAIR related metadata;
*	To evaluate the FAIRness of an ontology; 
*	To maintain different releases of ontology as part of version management;
*	To provide ontology artifacts in different encoding formats;
*	To categorise the ontology as per topics for better discovery;
*	To search and browse terms across all the ontologies;
*	To annotate a piece of text with all the ontologies;
*	To store and serve mappings between ontologies (inside and outside the portal).

## Vision: 
IndustryPortal aims to promote reuse of ontology in the semantic data application in industries by providing a sustainable, FAIR, and Open repository for the persistence of ontology from Industrial domain. Furthermore, IndustryPortal aspires to serve as a platform for the ontology life-cycle and a pivotal link in the complete tool-chain required for enterprise-level ontology-driven data management projects. 

## Mission: 
IndutryPortal offers a trusted and open repository for storing, versioning, and maintaining metadata of an ontology. It provides in-built visualisation tools which will let users view the content of the ontology without using any separate tool. Furthermore, IndustryPortal also provides many other tools e.g.,  class browser, annotator, and recommendation to find suitable ontologies for a specific data. IndustryPortal provides a detailed set of metadata and an in-built FAIRness evaluation tool ([O'Faire](https://github.com/agroportal/fairness)) to guide users to users to ensure the FAIReness of their ontology. IndustryPortal strives to create a community of dedicated users and moderators to ensure accuracy and relevancy of the ontologies and their metadata.
