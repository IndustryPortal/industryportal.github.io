## How to use IndustryPortal?
The primary functions of IndustryPortal span across typical ontology engineering
phases. In the following figure, we map these functions against the different steps of [Linked Open
Terms (LOT)](https://lot.linkeddata.es/) methodology, a popular methodology for ontology engineering. To
find an existing ontology base for the implementation of a new ontology, e.g., use an
upper-level ontology for some domain application, or to model data, IndustryPortal
provides several ways: 1) Search ontology –for finding an ontology by name, category, topic, group, and other metadata, 2) Search by class –for finding relevant ontology by
a certain term 3) Recommender – for finding one or a set of ontologies for a list of
terms. Fig. 2 shows an illustration of the IndustryPortal features. While using more than
one ontology for implementation, users can also ensure mapping among the ontologies
by using or editing the mappings stored in IndustryPortal (computed by LOOM matcher
by default but new mapping may be added manually). Most importantly, a newly developed ontology can be submitted to IndustryPortal or an existing ontology may be
updated with a new version.

## How to find an ontology for reuse?
IndustryPortal provides several ways to find an ontology for your use. If the name of the ontology is known, [Ontology Browser](http://industryportal.enit.fr/ontologies), that comes with many
filters, may be used. To search concepts across all the ontologies in the portal, [Class Browser](http://industryportal.enit.fr/search) may be used. Two advanced tools: [Recommender](http://industryportal.enit.fr/recommender) 
and [Annotator](http://industryportal.enit.fr/annotator) may be used to find one or many ontologies for a certain structured or unstructured data. The use of these tools can be found in the general 
ontoportal [documentation](https://www.bioontology.org/wiki/BioPortal_Help).

## How to submit an ontology?
For a new ontology that is not available in the IndustryPortal, please start from [Submit New Ontology](http://industryportal.enit.fr/ontologies/new).


For submitting a new version of an ontology that is already available in IndustryPortal, first search the ontology from [Ontology Browser](http://industryportal.enit.fr/ontologies) 
and then in the
